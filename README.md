This notebook allows you to convert any .mp4 or .m3u8 video from internet to .mp3 and generate transcriptions with proper paragraphs. OpenAI [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) is used for trascriptions and [sentence transformer](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) is used for sentence embedding. Embeddings are used to generate paragraphs and line breaks using similar method to this [article](https://medium.com/@npolovinkin/how-to-chunk-text-into-paragraphs-using-python-8ae66be38ea6). OpenAI chatGPT3.5_turbo is used to generate notes from the source text. Some potential usecases for this project include generating transcriptions or notes for lectures or online meetings. You could also generate trascriptions for online podcasts with little code modification.
